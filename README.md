Gameplay
Use the W and S keys to move the left paddle up and down, respectively.
Use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down, respectively.
The objective of the game is to hit the ball with your paddle and score points by making the ball touch the opponent's side. The player who reaches the score limit first wins.

Updates
The following updates have been made to fix the biggest bugs in the game:

Fixed an issue where the ball would bounce out of the left goal instead of scoring a point.
Addressed an infinite scoring bug that allowed the left player to gain infinite points by scoring once in the right side.
